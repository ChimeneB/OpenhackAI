# OpenhackAI
<br/>
Hello and welcome to Microsoft OpenHack, a challenge oriented hack event. This experience will be presented as a series of challenges, each one adding a new level of depth and complexity to a cloud-enabled Machine Learning solution.
<br/>
Teams should already be assigned and seated together. During your days of hacking, teams will attempt to solve as many challenges as possible.
<br/>
Team coaches are the first point of contact, and are available for technical support during the hack, but they will not solve challenges or provide answers for teams.
<br/>
#### The Premise
AdventureWorks, a major outdoor and climbing gear retailer, wants to understand customer behavior by learning more about the gear that consumers wear and will accomplish this with powerful Microsoft and open-source technologies for Computer Vision.
<br/>
#### The Challenges
Each challenge covers a stage of technical investigation for a machine learning solution. They will involve a good amount of Python programming.
<br/>
Challenges do not include guides or specific walk-through instructions, only useful hints and documentation references. Additionally, challenges can be completed in a number of ways. Coaches and the OpenHack Team will assist in validating solution correctness.
<br/>
New challenges are provided after a coach confirms the team has passed a challenge. Challenge information and team progress can be found in the Challenges section of the hack portal. Additionally, team versus team progress can be found on the Event Progress portion of the hack portal.
<br/>
#### One final tip: _Read everything very carefully_
The OpenHack team has worked hard to ensure that each problem is solvable and that all required details are included in the challenge briefs
Briefs are very carefully written and worded to give clues toward the solution
Reading challenges thoughtfully is the best way to figure out successful approaches, as nuances can be easily missed
Coaches will not give out the answers, but rather will be a resource to fill in any missing pieces in knowledge and skill, as well as help guide in the right direction.
